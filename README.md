## README

This repository contains a collection of custom `prodigy` recipes that I used throughout some of my research projects to annotate training data or iteratively devise regex patterns. Note that each input data is drastically downsampled.

**Annotation News** (`annotation-news`):<br>Multi-class, multi-label annotation recipe to label stock-price relevant events in business news articles.

**Annotation Rating Reports** (`annotation-rating-reports`):<br>Multi-class, multi-label annotation recipe to label rating rationales in rating press releases by Moody's.

**Annotation Roles** (`annotation-roles`):<br>Multi-class, multi-label annotation recipe to label business functions based on job titles.

**Annotation Transformation** (`annotation-transformation`):<br>Annotation recipes for binary and multi-class, multi-label classification tasks to identify transformation sentences.
