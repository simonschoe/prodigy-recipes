{"ric_coname":"Novartis AG","date":"2018-07-02","title":"BREAKINGVIEWS-Novartis contact lens spinoff defies messy optics","publication_datetime":"2018-06-29","weekday":"Friday","text":"(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)\n\nBy Neil Unmack\n\nLONDON, June 29 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Novartis\u2019 contact lens spinoff defies messy optics. Listing its Alcon division looks like an admission of failure for the Swiss pharma group, which spent $52 billion on the eyecare business seven years ago. Still, the separation should help both companies.\n\nAlcon is a textbook study in how not to do deals. Former Chief Executive and Chairman Daniel Vasella acquired a stake in the group from Nestl\u00e9 back in 2008, but the group didn\u2019t take full control in 2011 after a bruising fight with minority shareholders.\n\nBack then Alcon was growing by 7 percent a year and churning out operating margins of 35 percent. Within five years, margins had shrivelled to 15 percent. Vasella\u2019s successor Joe Jimenez acknowledged the group had cut costs too far and not invested enough.\n\nSince 2016 Novartis has managed to turn Alcon around, helped by a new divisional chief executive. Barclays analysts expect the operating margin to hit 18 percent this year, and predict sales growth of around 6 percent.\n\nSpinning off the subsidiary through a listing in Switzerland allows new CEO Vasant Narasimhan to take the long view. He could probably have sold Alcon, which despite its past woes remains the global leader in eye care. This option, however, allows investors to share in the company\u2019s future recovery, which includes hitting a long-term target for operating margins of around 25 percent.\n\nThe separation might create a little value. Berenberg analysts reckon a standalone Alcon could trade on perhaps 25 times forward earnings, a premium to Novartis' own multiple of around 13 times. That would imply a value of perhaps $30 billion.\n\nMeanwhile Novartis seems more interested in self-help than bold M&A. Narasimhan wants to do more \u201cbolt-on\u201d deals, perhaps for cancer treatments, but doesn\u2019t seem to be interested in hoarding cash. That makes sense: Novartis is still digesting two recent acquisitions, and wants to make its drug division more profitable. The $188 billion group on Friday also pledged to return $5 billion to shareholders.\n\nThe sale takes Novartis a step closer to becoming a more focused pharma group. The obvious remaining outlier is its 33 percent voting stake in Swiss rival Roche. Spinning that off would help investors see even more clearly.\n\nOn Twitter https:\/\/twitter.com\/Unmack1\n\nCONTEXT NEWS\n\n- Novartis said on June 29 it intended to spin off its Alcon eyecare division. The company will seek shareholder approval in February 2019, and complete the listing in the first half of that year.\n\n- The Swiss pharma group also said it would spend $5 billion buying back shares.\n\n- Novartis acquired Alcon for $52 billion in 2011. Alcon generated sales of $1.6 billion in 2017.\n\n- Novartis shares were up 3.4 percent at 74.9 Swiss francs by 0830 GMT on June 29.\n\n- For previous columns by the author, Reuters customers can click on\n\n- SIGN UP FOR BREAKINGVIEWS EMAIL ALERTS http:\/\/bit.ly\/BVsubscribe\n\n(Editing by Peter Thal Larsen and Bob Cervi)","meta":{"an":"LBA0000020180629ee6t00di5","publication_datetime":1530230400000,"date":"2018-07-02","fcode":"SNDOZ","ric_coname":"Novartis AG","ntype":"nw"}}
