{"text":"MOODY'S DOWNGRADES BAA PLC'S UN-GUARANTEED DEBT RATINGS TO Ba1\/N-P; MAINTAINS GUARANTEED DEBT RATINGS AT Baa2; MAINTAINS ALL RATINGS ON REVIEW FOR DOWNGRADE\n Approximately GBP1.049 Billion of Debt Affected\n\n London, 07 June 2006 -- Moody's Investors Service today downgraded to Ba1 from Baa3 the issuer rating of BAA Plc (\"BAA\") as well as the ratings for the GBP425 million convertible bonds due August 2009, the GBP424 million convertible bonds due April 2008 and the GBP200 million 7.875% bonds due February 2007 (together the \"Un-guaranteed Bonds\"). BAA's short-term rating was also downgraded to Not Prime from Prime-3. All other long-term debt ratings remain at Baa2. All long-term ratings remain on review for further downgrade.\n\n This rating action follows the announcement on 6 June 2006 that BAA intends to recommend to shareholders and convertible bond holders that they accept an offer from Airport Development and Investment Limited (\"ADI\") to acquire the shares and convertible bonds of BAA. Moody's notes that the acquisition would, if it went ahead, be predominantly debt-financed and would consequently increase the effective debt burden of the combined ADI \/ BAA group significantly to a level that would be inconsistent with an investment-grade credit rating at the BAA plc level -- hence the downgrade of the Un-guaranteed Bonds, the Issuer Rating and the short-term rating.\n\n However, those bonds (the \"Guaranteed Bonds\") that benefit from guarantees from Heathrow Airport Limited, Gatwick Airport Limited and Stansted Airport Limited (the \"Designated Airports\"), which constitute the majority of the rated bonds, are not downgraded. This reflects Moody's view, based on the current somewhat limited information and taking account of possible outcomes, that these debt obligations would remain commensurate with investment grade following completion of the proposed acquisition and execution of ADI's refinancing plans. Nevertheless, there remains a risk that following completion of the proposed acquisition ADI might be unable to create a refinancing structure that would retain an investment-grade credit rating for the Guaranteed Bonds, hence the continued review for downgrade of these ratings. Moody's also notes the possibility that another financial consortium may make an offer for BAA, on terms that are currently unknown but that may lead to a substantially leveraged position for BAA.\n\n ADI, a consortium comprising Grupo Ferrovial S.A. (approximately 64%), Caisse de dep\u00f4t et placement du Quebec (approximately 26%) and the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation Pte Ltd. (approximately 10%), has made an offer for all of the shares and convertible bonds of BAA that is estimated to cost GBP11.4 billion. ADI has advised that GBP4.3 billion will be financed by redeemable participating ordinary shares, GBP373 million by payment-in-kind notes and the balance by a series of debt facilities of varying levels of seniority, including GBP4.72 billion of Senior Acquisition Facilities. ADI has further advised that, shortly after the completion of the acquisition of BAA, it intends to refinance the Senior Acquisition Facilities with a longer-term financing structure based upon proven techniques adopted by other regulated companies. This process is intended to provide the medium- and long-term financing required to support the investment needs of BAA.\n\n The Baa2 ratings of the Guaranteed Bonds reflect Moody's view that the balance of interest for ADI \/ BAA would be on retaining an investment-grade rating for these bonds as part of the refinancing of the ADI Senior Acquisition Facilities. ADI could try to achieve this through the employment of structures adopted by other regulated companies which, provided certain structural features are incorporated, could enable the debt financing of the Designated Airports and the Guaranteed Bonds to be considered independently of the group debt. Given BAA's existing debt, its projected capital expenditure programme and business risks and the fact that ADI is likely to attempt to refinance at least part of the Senior Acquisition Facilities at a level pari passu with the Guaranteed Bonds, Moody's believes that a Baa1 rating of the Guaranteed Bonds would be unlikely given the financial headroom that would be required to maintain the rating, and that either a Baa2 or a Baa3 rating would therefore be a more likely outcome. If in the future Moody's takes the view that the Designated Airports will be required to support a level of debt inconsistent with an investment-grade credit rating, a downgrade of the ratings of the Guaranteed Bonds will likely follow.\n\n All ratings remain on review for downgrade pending the resolution of the acquisition of BAA by ADI and clarification of the initial financing and short-term refinancing plans of ADI. Consequently, Moody's review will focus on (1) the progress of the offer and whether or not an offer from another financial consortium emerges and the possible financial terms thereof, and (2) the detail of ADI's plans for BAA, including the capital structure of ADI \/ BAA and the status of the Guaranteed Bonds therein.\n\n Moody's last rating action on BAA was on 23 May 2006, when it downgraded the Guaranteed Bonds to Baa2 from Baa1, the Un-guaranteed Bonds and Issuer Rating to Baa3 from Baa1 and the short-term rating to Prime-3 from Prime-2, and maintained all ratings on review for further downgrade.\n\n Following this rating action, BAA has the following ratings outstanding:\n\n - GBP300 million 11.75% Bonds due 2016 -- Baa2 (guaranteed by the Designated Airports)\n\n - GBP250 million 8.5% Bonds due 2021 -- Baa2 (guaranteed by the Designated Airports)\n\n - GBP200 million 6.375% Bonds due 2028 -- Baa2 (guaranteed by the Designated Airports)\n\n - All Issuance under GBP4.5 billion Euro Medium-Term Note Programme -- Baa2 (guaranteed by the Designated Airports)\n\n - Issuer Rating -- Ba1\n\n - GBP425 million 2.625% Convertible Bonds due 2009 -- Ba1\n\n - GBP424 million 2.94% Convertible Bonds due 2008 -- Ba1\n\n - GBP200 million 7.875% Bonds due 2007 -- Ba1\n\n - Short-term rating -- Not Prime\n\n All long-term ratings are on review for downgrade.\n\n Headquartered in London, BAA plc owns and operates seven airports in the United Kingdom, including Heathrow, the world's busiest international airport, and Budapest Airport.

{"text":"MOODY'S DOWNGRADES BAA RATINGS TO Baa2\/P-3, MAINTAINS RATINGS ON REVIEW FOR FURTHER DOWNGRADE\n\n London, 23 May 2006 -- Moody's Investors Service today downgraded the ratings on the BAA long-term bonds guaranteed by certain operating subsidiaries to Baa2 from Baa1. In addition Moody's had downgraded the ratings of the GBP425 million 2.625% convertible bond due August 2009, the GBP424 million 2.94% convertible bond due April 2008, and the GBP200 million 7.875% bond due February 2007 (together the \"Un-guaranteed Bonds\") and the Issuer Rating to Baa3 from Baa1, and downgraded BAA's short-term rating to Prime-3 from Prime-2. All ratings remain on review for further downgrade.\n\n All BAA ratings were placed on review for downgrade on 10 April 2006, the last rating action. The downgrades reflect the changed financial policy announced yesterday, in which BAA announced that it will shortly send a letter to shareholders which will include a proposal to make a return of capital to shareholders of GBP750 million conditional upon the Ferrovial Consortium's or any other offer lapsing. The downgrades incorporate the likelihood that BAA's financial profile in the next few years will be commensurate with a Baa2 rating as a consequence of planned investment expenditure and revised traffic forecasts as well as the capital return. The two-notch downgrade of the Un-guaranteed Bonds and the Issuer Rating reflects the structural subordination of these instruments given that substantially all of BAA's other long-term debt benefits from guarantees from BAA's main cash flow generating subsidiaries, Heathrow Airport Limited, Gatwick Airport Limited and Stansted Airport Limited (together the \"Designated Airports\"). Moody's concludes that given the lower credit quality implied by a Baa2 rating, a distinction to reflect this structural subordination and exposure to any subsequent contractual or regulatory ring-fencing of the Designated Airports is now warranted.\n\n The ratings remain on review for further downgrade reflecting the fact that BAA is subject to a formal cash offer to purchase all of the share capital and convertible bonds of BAA by a consortium named Airport Development and Investment Limited (the \"Consortium\") led by Grupo Ferrovial S.A. (unrated), one of Spain's largest construction and contracting companies.\n\n Moody's review will continue while it remains possible that BAA may be subject to a debt-financed acquisition by the Consortium or any other party that may make a formal offer. However, if such an acquisition does not take place Moody's would likely affirm all ratings with a stable outlook.\n\n The Baa2\/P-3 ratings reflect BAA's dominant market position through its ownership of the Designated Airports, the system of price cap economic regulation to which they are subject, BAA's significant capital expenditure programme over the medium term, and Moody's expectation that BAA's financial profile will be commensurate with a Baa2 rating over the next few years. The ratings seek to accommodate the impact of the permitted tariff increases and higher debt service costs over the current regulatory period. The Designated Airports comprise the majority of BAA's revenues and operating profits and will remain the key cash flow driver of the group going forward. Over the next few months the process of determining the regulatory charges for BAA's next price cap period (5 years commencing 1 Apil 2008) will commence. The outcome of this review will be an important determinant of BAA's credit quality over the medium term.\n\n Moody's would likely downgrade BAA's ratings if it were subject to a debt-financed acquisition which resulted in materially higher debt levels supported by the assets and cash flow of BAA. In addition, any other significant acquisition activity by BAA or a material decline in BAA's business would likely pressure the rating.\n\n However, a substantial improvement in BAA's business or other cash generating measures such as asset sales, could result in a ratings uplift. \n\n Moody's understands that BAA has sufficient committed funding and other sources of liquidity to fund the return of capital and associated costs, and will also be able to meet any credit requirements that may arise from the GBP125 million loan from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation which has a rating trigger that could require BAA to procure third-party guarantees of or security for the loan if BAA's credit rating falls below A3. Consequently, BAA is expected to retain a solid liquidity profile. \n\n Following this rating action BAA has the following ratings outstanding:\n\n - GBP300 million 11.75% Bonds due 2016 -- Baa2 (guaranteed by the Designated Airports)\n\n - GBP250 million 8.5% Bonds due 2021 -- Baa2 (guaranteed by the Designated Airports)\n\n - GBP200 million 6.375% Bonds due 2028 -- Baa2 (guaranteed by the Designated Airports)\n\n - All Issuance under GBP4.5 billion Euro Medium-Term Note Programme -- Baa2 (guaranteed by the Designated Airports)\n\n - Issuer Rating -- Baa3\n\n - GBP425 million 2.625% Convertible Bonds due 2009 -- Baa3\n\n - GBP424 million 2.94% Convertible Bonds due 2008 -- Baa3\n\n - GBP200 million 7.875% Bonds due 2007 -- Baa3\n\n - Short-term rating -- Prime-3\n\n Headquartered in London, BAA plc owns and operates seven airports in the United Kingdom, including Heathrow, the world's busiest international airport, and Budapest Airport. BAA had total assets of GBP15.2 billion and pre-tax profits of GBP757 million for the year ended 31 March 2006.\n\n Paris Eric de Bodard Managing Director European Corporates Moody's France S.A.

{"text":"MOODY'S DOWNGRADES BAA'S LONG-TERM RATINGS TO Baa1, STABLE OUTLOOK\n Approximately EUR5.3 Billion of Long-Term Debt Instruments Downgraded\n\n London, 19 December 2005 -- Moody's Investors Service today downgraded to Baa1 from A3 the long-term issuer rating and debt ratings of BAA Plc (\"BAA\"), the UK airport operator, following BAA's announcement that it has signed an agreement to acquire 75% less one share of Budapest Airport Rt.'s share capital in conjunction with the granting of a 75 year asset management contract to Budapest Airport Rt. for the Budapest airport system, for a total cash consideration of GBP1.255 billion. BAA's Prime-2 short-term rating is not affected by this rating action and is affirmed. The outlook for all ratings is stable. This concludes the rating review initiated on 8 December 2005. \n\n Today's rating action reflects the weakening in BAA's credit metrics as a result of the additional indebtedness of about GBP1.3 billion from the proposed acquisition (taking into account existing debt at Budapest Airport). Moody's expects that over the next few years BAA will exhibit ratios below those regarded by the rating agency as the minimum consistent with a single-A rating (Adjusted Retained Cash Flow (\"Adj RCF\") to Net Adjusted Debt of 10% and Adjusted Funds From Operations (\"Adj FFO\") to Interest of 3.5x). However, the Baa1 rating also factors Moody's expectation that (i) aggregate business risk for the group will not deteriorate materially with the addition of Budapest Airport and (ii) over the intermediate term BAA's credit metrics are expected to show limited sensitivity to the performance of Budapest Airport given the size of Budapest Airport relative to BAA's other businesses.\n\n The stable rating outlook reflects Moody's expectation that, notwithstanding the increase in debt resulting from the acquisition of Budapest Airport and the ongoing large capital programme at BAA's London airports, BAA's will maintain Adj FFO Interest Cover at or above 3.0x and a ratio of Adj RCF to Net Adjusted Debt at or above 7.5%. Persistent failure to achieve these financial ratio thresholds would be likely to put negative pressure on BAA's ratings, as could any material negative implications of this overseas acquisition on the next regulatory price period commencing April 2008, a significant decline in traffic levels at BAA's London airports below expectations for an extended period of time (e.g. following a major catastrophic event), or further sizeable debt-financed acquisitions, which are not currently anticipated. Conversely, BAA's ability to consistently achieve an Adj FFO Interest Cover above 3.5x or a ratio of Adj RCF to Net Adjusted Debt above 10% would be likely to create positive pressure on the ratings.\n\n The Baa1\/P-2 ratings reflect BAA's dominant market position through its ownership of Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted Airports (the \"Designated Airports\"), the system of price cap economic regulation to which they are subject, and the expectation that BAA's Designated Airports will continue to comprise the majority of consolidated revenues and operating profits and will remain the key cash flow driver for the group going forward. Like all major airport owners, BAA is exposed to short-term losses of revenue from external factors, but generally operates in a growth industry that requires significant increases in capacity to accommodate this growth. This dynamic is somewhat mitigated by BAA's ability to reduce some of its planned capital expenditure in the event of a sustained downturn and by its conservative liquidity profile.\n\n Budapest Airport is the major airport serving the whole of Hungary and is currently wholly owned by the Hungarian Government. In 2004, the airport recorded 6.5 million passengers, with very small transfer traffic, and reported revenues of HUF33 billion (c. GBP90 million) and EBITDA of HUF15 billion (c. GBP40 million). The airport is experiencing significant growth (estimated at over 20% in 2005), which BAA will seek to exploit and maximise. Hungary's recent entry into the EU and the increase in flights by low-cost carriers have primed inward and outbound traffic, but starting from a low base. Moody's believes that Budapest Airport's growth potential has been the main driver for the very high opening price multiple bid by BAA.\n\n Unlike most of BAA's other debt obligations, the GBP425 million 2.625% Convertible Bonds due 2009, the GBP424 million 2.94% Convertible Bonds due 2008, and the GBP200 million 7.875% Bonds due 2007 do not benefit from upstream guarantees from BAA's subsidiaries owning the Designated Airports. However, these bonds are assigned a Baa1 rating given the relatively low default probability implied by BAA's Baa1 rating, the time horizon of the rating, and the generally shorter maturities of the un-guaranteed debt obligations versus the other bonds.\n\n The following long-term ratings of BAA Plc have been downgraded to Baa1 from A3:\n\n - Issuer Rating\n\n - GBP200 million 7.875% Bonds due 2007\n\n - GBP300 million 11.75% Bonds due 2016\n\n - GBP250 million 8.5% Bonds due 2021\n\n - GBP200 million 6.375% Bonds due 2028\n\n - GBP425 million 2.625% Convertible Bonds due 2009\n\n - GBP424 million 2.94% Convertible Bonds due 2008\n\n - All Issuance under GBP3 billion Euro Medium-Term Note Programme\n\n Headquartered in London, BAA plc owns and operates seven airports in the United Kingdom, including Heathrow, the world's busiest international airport. BAA posted total assets of GBP11.7 billion and pre-tax profits of GBP733 million for the year ended 31 March 2005.\n\n London Stuart Lawton Managing Director European Corporates Moody's Investors Service Ltd.

{"text":"Moody's downgrades Alliance Boots to B2; unsecured rating lowered to Caa1; outlook stable\n Approximately GBP300 million in rated securities affected.\n\n London, 09 July 2008 -- Moody's Investor Service today lowered the Corporate Family Rating of Alliance Boots Holdings Ltd. (formerly 'Alliance Boots plc', or 'the company') to B2 from B1, while the unsecured rating has been lowered to Caa1 from B2. The outlook is stable. This concludes the review that was initiated on 17 July 2007. Subsequently, Moody's intends to withdraw all ratings at the request of the issuer, as the company does not intend to seek a rating for Alliance Boots GmbH, the new holding company of the group.\n\n The B2 Corporate Family Rating reflects the company's generally solid market positions in both the wholesale and retail industry for pharmaceutical products, and the company's strategies to deal with changes in the industry. At the same time, the rating takes into account the very high indebtedness of the company, which is not expected to decline in the near future, such that the metrics remain weakly-positioned for the rating category.\n\n Moody's nevertheless regards the company as retaining a strong business profile in its core wholesale and retail markets. The company's results are published in the annual review of Alliance Boots GmbH, which reported a solid growth in profits in the financial year to 31 March 2008, with pro forma revenues of GBP15.3 billion, a 4.8% increase (1.9% on a like-for-like basis), and pro forma EBITDA of just over GBP 1billion, an increase of 17.9%. The company reported achieving GBP68 million of merger cost savings during the year, notably from harmonizing buying prices and reduced corporate costs.\n\n The group as a whole operates in 20 countries (including associated and joint ventures), while wholesale operations are more internationally-oriented as a result of the previous acquisitive expansion strategy of Alliance UniChem Plc (prior to its merger with Boots Group PLC in July 2006). Moody's believes that the group is well-positioned to take advantage of potential industry deregulation in European countries and higher growth opportunities in some of the countries where it retains associate and joint venture interests (Turkey, China). In the UK, which remains its predominant retail market, the company retains leading market shares in NHS drug dispensation, OTC and other health and beauty products, which Moody's views as having limited seasonality and generally positive growth prospects. Moody's notes, nevertheless, the ongoing penetration of supermarkets into this sector, and their potential to exert downward pressure on pricing and margins. In this regard Moody's views positively the company's strategy to become a more service-oriented retailer, for example with its Community Pharmacy concept.\n\n The GBP 300 million notes due May 2009, originally issued by The Boots Company PLC, are now held at Alliance Boots Holdings Limited, which contains all operating subsidiaries of the group excluding France. The notes and the term loans are held within the same security group. Alliance Boots GmbH, the reporting entity going forward, is outside the restricted group. However, Moody's understands that the security group contains substantially all assets, earnings and debt of the group, which removes the need to notch between the two entities at this time. Moody's notes, however, the existence of GBP1.5 billion in intercompany loans from the holding companies into the security group, which is being extended for nine years from July 2008.\n\n The company's debt capital structure consists of a Revolving Credit Facility (GBP820 million), Term loans B, D, E and F, and a subordinated loan (GBP750 million), which in the aggregate amount to GBP9.02 billion, with maturities between 2014 and 2017. Facility E (GBP1 billion) is a property bridge and Facility F (GBP 400 million) is a receivables bridge. Based on pro forma accounts for the group, Moody's estimates that total debt\/EBITDA for FY 2008, adjusted for leases, remained in excess of 8x, which remains high for the rating category and is the main constraint to the rating at this time.\n\n The term loans are secured on all material assets in the UK, France, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. The RCF and term loans B, E and F rank pari passu and are contractually senior to term loan D, which is second lien, followed by the subordinated loan. The Caa1 rating of the GBP300 million unsecured notes due May 2009, two notches below the Corporate Family Rating, therefore reflects their subordination to a substantial amount of secured debt within the capital structure.\n\n The company's liquidity is considered satisfactory. As of 31 March 2008, the company's main source of liquidity consisted of its Revolving Credit Facility, which remained undrawn. Moody's notes that GBP200 million of this is committed in the form of a bank guarantee for the pension scheme. The company retained GBP413 million in cash (excluding restricted cash). The company's short-term financial liabilities amounted to GBP365 million (excluding collateralized loan obligations), while the GBP300 million Eurobond matures in May 2009. In light of the company's high interest burden, in addition to ongoing capex plans, should free cash flows not be sufficient to repay the notes due 2009, Moody's would expect that the company will either refinance these as permitted under the terms of its loan agreements, or that it retains sufficient headroom within its RCF to repay them.\n\n Moody's views the rating as weakly-positioned in the current rating category. The stable outlook therefore reflects Moody's view that while leverage remains high for the rating category, the company's solid business profile and generally positive growth prospects should result in a gradually improving credit profile over the medium term. The rating assumes that leverage will trend below 8x over the next twelve to eighteen months in order to avoid potential negative pressure on the rating or outlook.\n\n Alliance Boots is an international pharmacy-led health and beauty group that was created in July 2006 through the merger of Boots Group PLC and Alliance UniChem Plc. In June 2007, the company was acquired with funds controlled by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. (\"KKR\") and Stefano Pessina, Alliance Boots' current Chairman. In FY2008 (to 31 March), Alliance Boots GmbH, the holding company, reported pro-forma revenues and trading profit of GBP15.3 billion and GBP771 million, respectively.\n\n Paris Myriam Durand Managing Director Corporate Finance Group Moody's France S.A.

{"text":"Moody's downgrades Alliance Boots plc to B1. Ratings are on review for possible downgrade.\n Approximately GBP 520mn of rated debt instruments affected\n\n London, 17 July 2007 -- Moody's Investors Service today downgraded the long term unsecured rating of Alliance Boots plc ('Alliance Boots', or 'the company') to B2 from Baa2. The rating remains on review for possible downgrade, where it was placed on 13 March 2007. A Corporate Family Rating for Alliance Boots has been assigned at B1 and is also on review for possible downgrade.\n\n The rating action reflects the expectation of a highly leveraged capital structure post completion of the financing for the acquisition of Alliance Boots by AB Acquisitions Ltd., a company jointly controlled by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. Ltd. (KKR) and Stefano Pessina, Alliance Boots' current Chairman. Although complete details of the capital structure are not fully in place, Moody's believes that based on the very significant indebtedness being assumed by the company, it is highly unlikely to be rated higher than B1, and could be rated lower.\n\n The transaction is being financed with secured term debt facilities amounting to GBP8.2bn and a GBP 820mn revolving credit facility. The one notch differential between the Corporate Family Rating and the Senior Unsecured rating reflects Moody's view that this will be the minimum notching to be expected once the capital structure is finalised.\n\n Ratings affected by today's action are as follows:\n\n - Corporate Family Rating assigned at B1;\n\n - Senior unsecured rating downgraded to B2 from Baa2.\n\n Alliance Boots plc was created in July 2006 through the merger of Boots Group PLC and Alliance UniChem Plc.
